# Meetup roles

At each Quorum meetup, we want to give individual organizers who plan to attend some light roles to help make our meetings go even more smoothly.
The goal here is two-fold:

1. Ensure everyone has a reason to be involved and build experiences and best practices that they can take back to their local meetups.
2. Share some of the responsibilities across the group as a whole so that our org doesn't depend on just one or two people to succeed. (No bus factors of one!) :bus:

With that in mind, here are some possible meetup roles:

- **Emcee** - This role is usually filled by the meetup organizer who arranged the speaker. They usually conduct the meeting agenda and help the speaker field questions at the end of the meeting.
- **Recording editor** - During the meeting, this individual will ensure that we started recording at the correct time. After the meeting is over, this individual will edit the recording to add title cards and upload it to YouTube. NOTE: We have some a few videos explaining the process.
- **Waiting room host** - This individual will jump on the call about 5-10 minutes early so that they can be assigned co-host status. At the top of the hour when the speaker and emcee feel ready to start the meetup, they will open the meeting and let everyone from the waiting room into the Zoom room. They will continue to monitor the waiting room and let people who join late into the Zoom room. At the end of the meeting, they'll post on Slack how many total attendees we had at the meeting for record-keeping.
- **Zoom video and audio moderator** - This individual will also be assigned co-host status during the meeting. They will mute participants who have accidentally unmuted themselves and are making distracting noises in the meeting. Only Zoom co-hosts have the ability to share screens, but if there are any issues with inappropriate sharing, this monitor will remove those participants from the meeting.
- **Zoom chat moderator** - This individual will assist the emcee as a second pair of eyes that will watch the Zoom chat for questions. They will engage in the chat if needed or also point out a question that was asked earlier in the meeting if the emcee or speaker misses the question. If a participant is not following the Code of Conduct or is making distracting and inappropriate comments, the moderator can feel empowered to remove the participant from the meeting.
- **Breakout room creator** - This individual would also be assigned co-host status. They could help create the breakout rooms for each meetup by monitoring which rooms need to be created and which ones have a local meetup organizer present to enter the room.
