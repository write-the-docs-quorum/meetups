# Zoom coordinator guide

Typically Alyssa takes on the role of the Zoom coordinator, but if there's ever a month where someone else needs to take on that role, this will guide you through the process!

Even if you don't ever sub for me, these can also serve as a best practices guide for hosting your own online events.

## Get access to a pro Zoom account

The first step is to get access to a pro Zoom account (hosts 100 participants for unlimited meeting lengths).
Alyssa pays for hers personally, but there is also an account available for any Write the Docs meetup coordinator to use.
For assistance getting access to the Write the Docs Zoom account, send a message to Rose W or Mike J. on WTD Slack.

If you use a professional Zoom account through your employer, ensure that you are not violating your company's policies and that you have permission to do so.
Write the Docs will also allow employers to sponsor events if your employer would like recognition for providing a professional Zoom room.


## Set up the Zoom meeting

After the meetup organizer has set a date and time for the event, create a Zoom event with the following settings:

- **Topic** - Give it a meaningful name, but be aware that you're the only one who will really see it.
- **Time Zone** - Make sure you're setting the event using the correct time zone.
- **Meeting ID** - Set to generate automatically (turned on by default).
- **Security** - Require a passcode (turned on by default).
- **Waiting Room** - Make sure this is activated (turned on by default).
- **Meeting options** - Check the boxes for:
  - Mute participants upon entry
  - Automatically record meeting (then select *In the cloud*)

After you save the meeting, you see the meeting details page.
On this page, click **Copy invitation** to get the Zoom details.
It gives more information than is needed.
Typically, you only need the URL.


## Create the Meetup event

We have a separate parent Meetup for each quorum program:

- [U.S. East Coast and Central](https://www.meetup.com/virtual-write-the-docs-east-coast-quorum/)
- [U.S. West Coast and Mountain](https://www.meetup.com/virtual-write-the-docs-west-coast-quorum/)

Before creating the Meetup event, you need the following:

- The event date and time provided by the meetup organizer
- The Zoom meeting URL
- The presentation title and description
- The presenter(s) name, title, and bio
- An image for the event (Alyssa has some on stock if you need)

On Meetup, create a new event.
For the event description, use this template for the **East Coast Quorum**:

```

## Publicize the meetup event

After creating the new Meetup event, publicize it to the following channels:

- Direct Slack message or email to the presenter(s) and/or meetup organizer
- Post on the `#meetup-organizers-quorum` Slack channel and tag either the East or West Coast organizers for awareness
- Post on the `groups.io` group for Quorum
- Send an email to the Write the Docs newsletter team: `newsletter@writethedocs.org`


## Host dry run event for presenter(s) and emcee

Coordinate with the meetup organizer and/or presenter to schedule a dry-run session if needed.
In this meeting you can:

- Review the meeting agenda
- Tell the presenter and emcee that you will be available 5-10 minutes before the event and will let them in to do a tech check if needed
- Do a tech check to make sure everyone is aware of how the technology works
- Plan icebreakers for [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/)
- Create new meetup slides using the [Quorum meetup slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k6eVd4DZNbQhQW0zWlsExHAosY-pkcSQQ6QxDJZ83bc/edit?usp=sharing)

NOTE: If you need Poll Everywhere account access, contact Alyssa.


## Wrangling local meetup organizers to RSVP regrets for the event

About a week before the event, remind everyone about the upcoming event and ask each local meetup organizer to RSVP their regrets.
You'll need to know which organizer doesn't have a representative there so that you will know whether to host a breakout room for them.


## Meetup announcements on the day of the event

I recommend sending the following announcement on the day of the event:

```
TITLE: Looking forward to tonight's meetup!

Hello, to all of you who have RSVPed for tonight's Write the Docs [East/West] Coast Quorum meetup event! We're pleasantly surprised that so many of you have signed up for today's event and we think you'll enjoy tonight's presentation.

However, be aware that we currently have more than 100 participants who have RSVPed for this event and our current Zoom account only allows 100 participants. While we don't think that more than 100 people will show up for tonight's event, we will have to cap attendance at 100 if more do arrive. If you are not fortunate enough to join us on the call or are unable to, be aware that we will record this presentation and post it on the Write the Docs YouTube channel soon after tonight's presentation.

On that note, here's our agenda for tonight (listed in [Eastern/Pacific] times):

7:00 to 7:10 - Social networking time and icebreaker activities

7:10 to 7:15 - Announcements

7:15 to 7:45 - Presentation and Q&A

7:45 to 8:00 - Breakout rooms by meetup - We'll use Zoom breakout rooms to have people meet with their local meetup organizers to say hi to other people in their area. Local meetup organizers will use that time to talk about local job openings, future meetups, and connect in a smaller group format. Even if you're not an official member of the meetup, you're welcome to stay and join one of the breakout rooms to connect with other attendees.
```

## Tips for running the actual Zoom call

The following are some best practices for running the actual Zoom call:


### Before the Zoom event officially begins

- The Zoom coordinator and the emcee should generally not be the same person.
- In the Zoom settings, make sure the meeting is automatically recorded to the cloud and that all participants are muted.
- The Zoom coordinator should be available 5-10 minutes early and allow the emcee and presenter into the meeting from the waiting room. Leave other participants in the waiting room until the official start time.
- Assign co-hosting privileges to the presenter(s) and the emcee so that they can share their screen and as a back-up if your network connection goes down. See [Using co-host in a meeting](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-Enabling-and-adding-a-co-host)


### During the Zoom event

- The Zoom coordinator typically shares the slides from their computer, including the Poll Everywhere icebreakers.
- Make sure the Zoom chat window is open and that you're monitoring it.
- Have the Poll Everywhere link available in a text file and paste it into the Zoom chat when ready.
- While the speaker is presenting, monitor the participants to see if you need to mute anyone.
- While the speaker is presenting, set up the breakout rooms for each local meetup. See [Managing Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313).


### At the end of the Zoom event

- Before the breakout rooms begin, make sure you **thank the speaker** and encourage everyone to mime their applause, use jazz hands, or use their applause emoji.
- Explain how to join a breakout room.
- Open the breakout rooms.
- As breakout rooms start to clear out, you can pull the remaining participants back into the room to encourage them to end their conversations before you end the meeting.


## Handing off the recording

Ryan handles the editing and posting of our videos for our events.
When the recording is available:

- If you recorded on the cloud, send Ryan the link and passcode to download.
- If you recorded on your computer, send Ryan the video through a direct message on Slack.

Ryan also needs the following information in order to create the video title cards:

- Presentation title
- Presenter name
- Date of presentation
- Which quorum event it was (East Coast or West Coast)
- Name of the host (emcee) and meetup chapter
- Presentation description (will become the video description)

Ryan will share the link with you when it's available.


## Publishing and announcing the video

After the video is available, send one last message to the meeting attendees:

```
TITLE: Video of "presentation title" is now available

Thank you to all of you who were able to attend our recent session with the [presenter name]. If you missed the event or would like to revisit the talk, it's now available on the Write the Docs YouTube channel: [link]

We have meetups once a quarter, so our next event will be in [month of next meetup]. We hope to see you there!
```
