# Meeting agenda (detailed)

This page gives a more detailed explanation of the meeting agenda. It will
list resources and best practices for each segment of the meetings.

## Overview of meeting agenda

Our meetings will last an hour and will follow this agenda and time structure:

- **7:00 to 7:10 - Icebreakers and announcements** - For the first 10 minutes, remote attendees can join and participate in icebreaker activities. Then, the emcee will give announcements and introduce the speaker.
- **7:15 to 8:00 - Presentation and Q&A** - The speaker can spend about 30-45 minutes giving a presentation, which includes the Q&A portion. The Q&A can expand to fill the time if the presentation is short.
- **7:45 to 8:30 - Breakout rooms by meetup** - Attendance at this portion of the meetup is optional. We'll use Zoom breakout rooms to have people meet with their individual meetup organizers to say hi to other people in their meetup. Organizers can use that time to talk about job openings, talk about future meetups, and socialize.


## Icebreakers and announcements

This segment of the Zoom call is most effective if someone is in charge of
encouraging discussion by asking attendees questions or inviting new people to
introduce themselves. The goal is to make people feel welcome and get them
socializing.

One particularly effective WTD presenter at a Bay Area Zoom meetup used this
time to give participants an open-ended anonymous poll with some icebreaker
questions. He displayed the poll results and used everyoneâ€™s answers to ask
questions that helped him get to know his audience and warm them up for the
presentation.

In the Quorum program, we sometimes ask poll questions using
[Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/).


## Presentation and Q&A

See [Emcee script](emcee-script.md) for guidance on how to run announcements,
presentation, and Q&A.


## Breakout rooms by meetup

During the social networking time, participants will answer a Poll Everywhere
survey question about which breakout room they would like to be assigned to.
The person running the Zoom call will use this information to assign people to
breakout rooms during the session. If someone in the Zoom room does not fill
out the survey, the Zoom coordinator can send them a private Zoom chat message
asking what they would prefer.
