# Running a tech check and optional dry run-through

As a best practice, the Quorum meetups recommend meeting with the emcee and speaker to do a tech check, typically about a week before the Quorum event.
The speakers can also do an optional dry run-through of their talk if desired.
The purpose of the tech check is to:

- Make sure the speaker and emcee are comfortable with the Zoom platform.
- Provide an overview of the Quorum meetup schedule to the upcoming event.
- Find out what kind of icebreaker questions the speaker wants to ask.
- Ask how the speaker how they would prefer to take questions.
- Answer any additional questions or address concerns from the speaker and emcee.


## Pitching the tech check

After we've got the details of the event scheduled, I like to send an invite to a tech check:

"Thanks for being willing to speak! Would you be willing to meet with me and [emcee] the week before the Quorum event to do a 30 minute tech check?
We've found it sets our speakers up for success on the night of the event and by giving us a chance to discuss logistical details and answer questions.
In this meeting, we can also talk about possible icebreaker questions you might want to ask the audience and make sure that you have all the resources you need.
If you'd like, we can also do a dry run-through of your talk if you feel that would help you.
Let us know if you want to do a dry run-through so that we can plan to make the tech check a little longer if needed."



## Before the tech check

Shortly before the tech check:

- Make a copy of the Quorum slides for the event and fill in the initial slides.
- Login to Poll Everywhere and create a few sample icebreakers for this event.
- Maybe include some of the icebreakers questions from past events.
- Have the Meetup event up.
- Have a second monitor set up with the participant version of Poll Everywhere
- Maybe have a new icebreaker poll open to show what the options are.
- Maybe have a list of possible icebreakers open:

## Agenda for the tech check

1. Introductions
   - Introduce ourselves (name, location, role at work)
   - Introduce Write the Docs and Quorum

2. Thank you for being willing to speak!

3. Provide a high-level overview of the meeting schedule
   - Ask if they can be available 5-10 minutes before the call to make sure they are there and ready.
   - Might be easiest to just share the Meetup link.
   - Does this schedule seem okay to you?

4. Go through the Google Slides.
   - Get their email addresses and share the slide deck.
   - On the icebreaker slide, demo Poll Everywhere live and discuss what questions you might ask.
   - On the "This talk is recorded" slide, ensure that recording is okay.
   - On the "warm welcome" slide, ensure the intro is okay and ask if that's how the speaker wants to be introduced.
   - On the breakout room slides, ask if the speaker would like to leave after the presentation or stay around.

5. Ask how the speaker prefers to take questions.

6. Ask if the speaker would like to leave after the presentation and Q&A or join one of the breakout rooms.

7. Run through protocol for what to do when a Zoom bomber occurs.
   - We've only had a Zoom bomber one time, but we want to be prepared in case it happens again.
   - Here's what we do when we set up the meeting:
     - We always enable a waiting room so we can screen guests entering in.
     - We always require a meeting passcode.
     - We also mute participants upon entry.
   - We only give screen sharing permissions to the host and co-host. Sometimes a Zoom bomber might send you a request for access to share their screen while you are speaking. If you see this request, go ahead and stop your presentation and say, "Someone is asking for permission to share my screen."
   - If I suspect a Zoom bombing is beginning, I will immediately implement security measures that will:
     - Lock the meeting so that no new people could join.
     - Turn off everyone’s profile pictures and videos.
     - Stop all screen sharing, including your presentation. (People with host privileges could still screen share after that initial interruption.)
     - Turn off people’s ability to rename themselves.
     - Suspends the chat.
   - When that happens, I'll ask if you are feeling okay to continue. **It is okay if the answer is no.** However, if you answer yes, I will continue to keep the meeting in lockdown until a significant amount of time has passed. I will slowly re-introduce some permissions to the group one at a time.

8. Do you want to do a dry run of your presentation at all?

9. Do you have the link to the event? Do you need us to send it to you?

10. Any additional questions or concerns?
